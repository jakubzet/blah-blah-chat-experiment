A simple chat application prepared just to present some JavaScript APIs (Observers, WebSockets, SSE).

Included code is simplified just to present specific use cases of Socket and SSE-based communication between client and server apps.

## How to run?
1. Install packages via `npm install`.
2. Create `.env` file basing on attached `.env.sample`.
3. Run script `npm run dev` (or `npm run dev:client` and `npm run dev:server` in separate terminals).
